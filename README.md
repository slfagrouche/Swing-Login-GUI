# Swing-Login-GUI
This program is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to enter their username and password. It checks if the entered username and password match a combination in the user map, and displays a success message if it does. If it does not, the program displays an error message. The program also has a clear button that clears the user and password text fields and the success message. The program's GUI is created using the Java Swing library, while the background image is displayed using the Java AWT library.
